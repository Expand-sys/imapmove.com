# imapmove.com

Very easy to set up, simply clone repo, cd into folder, run npm install and run node index.js, if you want to deploy with passenger or another similar program which we recommend you do, make sure the app root is set to the folder and the document root is set to public. 

### Notes
* There is no logging of passwords or imap servers or usernames, emails are stored once, transfered then overwritten, and will be deleted at the end(not in current version at time of release but working on it right now)
* the current official deployment is available at https://imapmove.com
* this is available for free with no limits attached, though if it becomes too popular i may need to get funding for its own server just a disclaimer
